# build

A tool combining dependency lookup and dependency generation.

C++ only.

Test project!

Part of the goal is to handle generated source code.  With make, doing that only ever ends up crazy in my experience.  I need some way to figure out the dependencies within the make logic.  I forget exactly what my issues were with make right now to be honest.  But it was basically like you couldn't conditionally generate makefile dependency files.  You have to do them all.  And if there's a generated .h, then you need to redo those dependencies after it's generated.  I definitely gave it a try.  Maybe I should provide an example of the deficiencies in this repo.

A lot of this is old local versions that I am fastforward committing.  Each version might not work.

The actual current implementation is in C++, but I was using perl before.  So any perl stuff is old.

I only ever build from the root of the src tree:
    cd examples;
    build A.o;
    build main.o;
    build main.exe;
    make clean;

This leads to issues like how includes.pm only works in current directory.  Oops.

In the example project (./example), "generated" source code is just copied in from the "gen" subdirectory.  In reality it would be generated by some other utility, like an IDL to C++ compiler.
