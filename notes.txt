v3.pl does gen include redep, but src gen redep should be able to trigger more inc gen, but it doesn't. similar issue goes to obj as well. I think I need to break up 'doThings' more and not call that whole thing and instead just do passes in a while loop until there's nothing left to be done. see v4.pl

v4.pl made some good progress with depencies vs generation, and what needs to be done for each file type. but it doesn't work for the initial obj.  main.o needs main.c but it tries to gen main.o and then doesn't know main.c.  and I don't have the information about what other objects are needed for linking main.  like I have the concept to go generate them and/or parse their dependencies, but I don't store information about how I got there.  so then when I go to generate the main, I don't know what to use. for v5 I want to restructure the data so that I can come back at the end and say "link /o main.exe main.o A.o B.o ...".
